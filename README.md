##Agile-Fire
Demo agile project management tool. Not much progress to this point, just some simple boilerplate and hooks into firebase repo.

##Requirements
You will need NodeJS and Grunt

##Running the application
After cloning the project run `npm install` to get the dependencies. Then run `grunt server` which will start a local server on port 9000 and launch the default web browser to the application index page.

##Live Reload
One of my favorite things in the world (these days) is live reload. As you edit files in the app directory, the changes will be pushed automatically to the browser through a web socket. It makes an old schooler like me smile every time.
